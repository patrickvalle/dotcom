          <p>Patrick is such a cool guy that he is my best friend from my previous co-op, my first full-time job and my current company. 
          Without Patrick Zus wouldnt be the same and his morning motivation should be mentioned in TED talks. He is not scared to tell you that you did something dumb by breaking the prod, 
          but he will also be the person that will tell you breaking the prod is part of the process. 
          He has definitely made me a more confident prod-breaker (it's a compliment, trust me). 
          He has helped me from my first day to my last and seeing him in Boston on my last day was the best gift anyone could ask for. 
          One day I wish to be a Patrick to some co-op. We will definitely drink some Diplomatico the next time we meet, 
          but until then don't forget your resident co-op-come-full-time-employee.<br> - Aditya Saha, future Lens/UPI engineer</p>

          <p>Best Aaron Rodgers understudy. Holds himself and the team to a high standard of rigor and diligence in scoping work and executing on it. 
          Keeps things light-hearted even in challenging situations, huge boost for team chemistry and morale. 
          Pushes back effectively and thoughtfully on requirements or work that is not worth the effort. Powerful combo of strong knowledge, 
          experience, and skill with extreme humility. Carries his belongings in a plastic bag with confidence. <br> - Max Tabachnik, Product @ Zus</p>

          <p>Patrick and I were DESTINED to cross paths. Who else in their right mind would dabble in food logistics, transit tracking, 
          and then go into health tech? Bad ideas are better than no ideas. Keep them coming!! 
          Thanks for all the supportive zoom chat messages every time I get on my soapbox and pontificate my usual content that’s 50% wrong. 
          Patrick is secretly one of the best Java developers at the company… such dark history. Patrick also secretly wants to join the FQS team amirite? 
          We are forever grateful for Patrick’s head-banging on Kafka testing. <br> - Sonya Huang, FQS engineer</p>
