          <p>Patrick is such a cool guy that he is my best friend from my previous co-op, my first full-time job and my current company. 
          Without Patrick Zus wouldnt be the same and his morning motivation should be mentioned in TED talks. He is not scared to tell you that you did something dumb by breaking the prod, 
          but he will also be the person that will tell you breaking the prod is part of the process. 
          He has definitely made me a more confident prod-breaker (it's a compliment, trust me). 
          He has helped me from my first day to my last and seeing him in Boston on my last day was the best gift anyone could ask for. 
          One day I wish to be a Patrick to some co-op. We will definitely drink some Diplomatico the next time we meet, 
          but until then don't forget your resident co-op-come-full-time-employee.<br> - Aditya Saha, future Lens/UPI engineer</p>

          <p>Best Aaron Rodgers understudy. Holds himself and the team to a high standard of rigor and diligence in scoping work and executing on it. 
          Keeps things light-hearted even in challenging situations, huge boost for team chemistry and morale. 
          Pushes back effectively and thoughtfully on requirements or work that is not worth the effort. Powerful combo of strong knowledge, 
          experience, and skill with extreme humility. Carries his belongings in a plastic bag with confidence. <br> - Max Tabachnik, Product @ Zus</p>

          <p>Patrick and I were DESTINED to cross paths. Who else in their right mind would dabble in food logistics, transit tracking, 
          and then go into health tech? Bad ideas are better than no ideas. Keep them coming!! 
          Thanks for all the supportive zoom chat messages every time I get on my soapbox and pontificate my usual content that’s 50% wrong. 
          Patrick is secretly one of the best Java developers at the company… such dark history. Patrick also secretly wants to join the FQS team amirite? 
          We are forever grateful for Patrick’s head-banging on Kafka testing. <br> - Sonya Huang, FQS engineer</p>

          <p>@Patrick is the backbone of the UPI/Lens team. He loves to keep us organized by using Jira. He is smart and funny, really the trifecta! 
          I can always count on Patrick to fix my mistakes, debug my problems and tell me what I did wrong. When I joined Patrick's team he was on vacation 
          but when he got back he helped me get onboarded and didn't complain about all of my questions, he made me feel welcome on my new team. Patrick laughs at all of my jokes
          even when they aren't that funny. I can really count on Patrick when the game goes into over time. 
          Long story short I would recommend Patrick to all my friends! <br> - Sarah Mangels, Lens/UPI engineer</p>

          <p>Patrick is a great developer and an even better big game hunter. He is always responsive to lens questions and troubleshooting. He is always bringing good vibes to Zus. Patrick helped me get the Go debugger working in VS Code when no one else would. <br> - Eric Gunther, Workflows Engineer</p>

          <p>Though I haven't been able to work with you too closely, everytime you have the opporunity to help me in anyway you go above and 
          beyond to make sure that if I want help I know that I can count on you. You follow up to make sure everyones doing okay and is getting 
          the help or support that they need. You are very selfless with your time and energy and I think everyone at zus appreciates that. 
          You are also very fun to be around despite being from NJ and I have really enjoyed getting to know you the last few months. 
          Hope we get to work together more in the future!!! <br> - Sarah Faller, FQS engineer</p>
